# GDVMaximiser
Program Implementation:
- The concept of this program is to show the top combinations of properties that can fit in a given area whilst maximising the GDV of the property.
- The solution to the problem utilises the dynamic programming coin changing algorithm.

Future Development:
- Take roads and gardens into account. This currently is done manually before using the program.
- Process a land map and maximise the number of properties within a given area.
- Produce a visualisation of each property mapped out onto the land.
